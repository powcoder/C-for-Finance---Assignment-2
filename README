Data files for C++ For Finance 2019/20 Assignment 2
===================================================

What you have
-------------

There are 4 files inside this zip:

  * README     - This file
  * People.csv - An example of the client file (CSV format)
  * People.tsv - An example of the client file (TSV format)
  * Feed.dat   - An example of the product feed

The two People files contain identical data, just saved in the two different
formats.

The Feed is in chronological order by product initial availability - the data
used to mark your program is guaranteed to be the same.  Remember your program
cannot use data from later lines of the feed to retrospectively change how
much or when to invest in previous products.  Imagine that you only become
aware of products on the date they become available and you cannot
time-travel.

About the data
--------------

All data, except people's names, has been randomly generated (using biased
distributions in some cases).  Any discernible words or patterns, especially
in the institution names or product codes, is coincidental and unintentional.

Names have been taken from the uk-500.zip file downloaded from
https://www.briandunning.com/sample-data/ 2020-03-10.
